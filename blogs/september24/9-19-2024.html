  <h2>Back</h2>
  <p>So it's been a long time since my last blog. i been moving websites hosting and been working on some project. but we need to talk about the projects. what have i been working on? well here is a break down:</p>
  <h2>hazzy</h2>
  <p>i been working on hazzy. if you do not know by now i been working on a game called hazzy and it is a kaiju paradise and undertale fan game (with a bit of changed). i had the idea for this project for over 3 years and i am making it. right now i got some play testers to play test the first build before it goes out to the public. after that the game will come out to the public as a beta test. i hoping this all goes well. this has been a dream project for a while.</p>
  <h2>The Internet Archive</h2>
  <p>So this is a funny story. i was going to use my internet archive account just to store my star projects but some one took my username Drwhomust so in rage i started archiveing stuff. yep you heard that right. i did that for some reason and i am still am right now. you can check it out <a href="https://archive.org/details/@drwhomust694/web-archive" target="_blank">here</a></p>
  <h2>Forked Projav</h2>
  <p>so i have forked a project called the PojavLauncher and been trying to improve it. the reason being is that trying to put mods in minecraft for PojavLauncher is very hard and i have to use my <i>hacking skills</i> to just transfer 1 .jar file and i hate it. so i been working on a way to download mods without using custom SDKs or the file exploer. <a href="https://github.com/nightcrawcode/PojavLauncher2x" target="_blank">Check it out here</a></p>
  <h2>so... that's it?</h2>
  <p>yeah. sorry if i had to make it short blog because i been really busy with school and these projects. i am hoping if i can get done with them sooner but school is holding that goal back. i wanted to make this blog because i have not posted anything online for a bit of time and some people though i was dead. so i wanted to let you all know what i been up to. so ya, i will try to make a another blog in a week or so but until then. this is Drwhomust the nightcrawler signing off from your local lab (also drink water)</p>
