  <h1>Hazzy development update (and something spooky)</h1>
  <p>Ok let's get the elephant out of the room... or a cat? fox? red panda? what ever she is Hazzy is almost done (after the development issues) and I want to talk about what been happening behind the scenes and a few more pieces of information. And also I want to show you all something spooky that will be happening in Halloween! but first</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Hazzy development progress</h2>
  <br>
  <p>So here we are, hazzy first public beta release will come out on October 30th (it's on Halloween, coincidence? I think not) and will come with a version of the game that has the first part of the story done and a little bit of the second part. the reason why I am releasing small parts of the stories instead of the entire game at once is because that helps reduces stress for me when working on this project and makes it easier to manage what happened in the game's code. and if you haven't seen the latest message from the game's discord (join here) Right now I have switched to my sixth game engine for the project. I am currently using RPGMaker MV with a bunch of workshop plugins. Right now it's working gray and it should be okay at least to be released for the first public beta release. (The only thing that is scaring me right now is to copyright issues). however, the game might be delayed because of how much progress I made at the moment. But I really want to take my time on this because I had the idea for this game for over 3 years and I really wanted to make this high quality because the story is high quality and I really want to make the gameplay high quality as well so it could be a nicer experience. anyway, it's just a current development issues I'm currently experiencing. I'm about to get technical here so if you don't want to see some technical nonsense, I recommend just moving on to the next section of just blog. if not stay tuned. basically, RPG maker is being a big dummy right now with this rights and it's been really hard importing the sprites from the old game engine (Gamemaker) and also that the battle plug-in that I'm using for the game is very confusing toward, but I'm starting to get the hang of it a bit. But I may have broken the engine a few times when I'm trying to modify the plugins code with JavaScript so some of the battles for the bosses can have their attacks synced in with the music. But it keeps breaking. luckily I have a backup of the projects so I can restore it. but for now I may have to go with unsynced attacks.</p>

  <h2>spooky thing</h2>
  <br>
  <p>Spooky time is coming right around the corner. so my school is probably going to allow students and I am going as Fred Flintstone. But I want you to make the game about Halloween. I know it's about a bit too late for that because if I start now I'm probably going to get it done by the end of Halloween or probably late by Halloween. but who cares? I'm going to do it. so the idea is that you play as this ghost which tries to repossess his old body but gets into a lot of trouble while doing so. pretty funny idea which I'm going to do just for fun and I want to give my friends something to play for Halloween.</p>
  <br>
  <p>phew! that was a long blog. I'm hoping that by the time I release hazzy to itch.io I should use the dev logs on there but for now I am using my blogs and hazzy's discord. anyways thanks for reading</p>
